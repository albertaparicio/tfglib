Voice Conversion TFG Libraries
==============================

This package contains all auxiliary libraries and functions required by the 
models in **tfg-voice-conversion**.

It is written to be compatible with Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.5.
Additionally, older versions of 3.x may work fine, but it has not been tested.
